6.0.0 / 2015-12-30
==================
* Moving all source code to `/src` directory
* Transpiling JS with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
* Adding `Other Guidelines` section to CONTRIBUTING.MD
* Updating README with Grunt CLI tasks
* Update postpublish script to reference transpiled code
* Freezing dependency versions (this allows us to ensure the module and grunt tasks always have consistent/repeatable behavior)
